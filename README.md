# Trails
Mapping trails using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Open trails.html in browser, nothing else required.

Create a path by pressing the 'N' key, then click your path and finish with 'Enter'.

#### Mouse
- Left click: Add path segment
- Right click: Remove path segment
- Scroll: Zoom
- Drag: Move map / SHIFT: Zoom to selection

#### Keys
- N: New path
- O: Open GeoJSON path
- S: Save all current paths as GeoJSON
- E: Edit last path
- Enter: Finish path (SHIFT: set path color)
- Back/Delete: Remove last path segment
- Space: Move along path (SHIFT: keep centered)
- ALT +/-: Adjust movement speed
- Escape: Stop moving / Delete unfinished path
- D: Show distances

When in doubt, refer to the _i_ in the upper left corner of the map. Individual trails can be toggled in the upper right hand corner, along with satellite view or OpenStreetMap.
